        <h3>Automatic Plant Watering System (IoT)</h3>
        <p>
            Designed and implemented an IoT-based automatic irrigation system using Arduino Uno integrated with humidity and rain sensors. The system monitored real-time environmental conditions and automatically controlled watering to optimize water usage. Cloud platforms such as Blynk and ThingSpeak were used for remote monitoring, data visualization, and system control, providing an efficient and smart plant care solution.

    <h2>Internship</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Analyst Intern – Hinisys Software Pvt Ltd (Jun 2025 – Aug 2025)</strong><br>
        During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in Power BI by developing interactive dashboards to analyze customer shopping behavior and sales performance. I worked with real-time data from Google Sheets using API integration, performed data cleaning and transformation, and applied DAX to create key metrics and insights. The project helped me understand data visualization best practices and how analytics supports business decision-making.
